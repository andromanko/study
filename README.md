Fuzzy logic in mobile robot
This is my magister dissertation in BNTU'2004.
This program modeling the mobile robot in 2D-unpredictable space.
It is a simple program, written on Borland C++.
It has some serious BUGs, and robot can drive throught walls -)
You can chose the number of demo and push the button "DEMO" so the robot will start. 
Enjoy!
